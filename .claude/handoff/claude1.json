  "message": "Fixed the 'wrong Andrew Weiss' bug. When viewing an artist from the graph (like Andrew Weiss of Butthole Surfers), the detail panel was showing albums/images for a different Andrew Weiss because Last.fm was searched by name. Now uses MBID for accurate lookups. Production live with commit 5de1560.",
